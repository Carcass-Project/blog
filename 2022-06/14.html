        <h1>2022-06-14: I am incredibly bored.</h1>

        <p>So I decided to build my blog. I made this decision out of boredom, so I don't die of it, and I'm keeping up quite nicely.</p>
        <p>I wanted to make a coooool blog, so it will be interactive too, and stuff. :)</p>
        <p>Anyway today's an interesting day. I got invited to a fancy evening by my school for being so smart. ðŸ¤“</p>
        <p>I had like 3 classes today(June am I right?), and now I'm locked up in my mother's workplace.</p>
        <p>There's time left till I get out too, like 4 hours(ugh.), and I am just bored out of my mind.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Decided to test my Github Codespaces skills, so I am using it too now, since I got in the beta(yay)</p>
        <p>I'm gonna keep this blog over the summer, and I'll probably end it after summer, since it isn't the most comfortable way to write something, haha.</p>
        <p>About my codespaces skills... They suck, I can't figure out how to get Github Pages to work with this.</p>
        <p>I also need to learn german, ..fluck.</p>

        <p>Bye! &gt;3</p>
